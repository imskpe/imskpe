Installation Instructions v 3.03 (April 1994)
---------------------------------------------

Unix Boxes...

On a unix machine, type 'make' to compile a copy of klatt in the
current directory. 'make install' will copy the relevant files into
the required installation binary and manual page directories. These
directories are specified at the top of the makefile and can be edited
according to local site requirements.

Use 'make clean' to remove all files created during compilation and
installation. This will leave you with the original distribution.

The code uses the 'proto' macro in an attempt at portability between
ANSI and K&R style C compilers. It has successfully been compiled
using 'cc' and 'gcc' on the Sun Sparc architecture. 

PC Boxes...

I have compiled this code successfully under Microsoft C 7.0. I've used the
_MSC_VER flag to do some conditional compilation, which seems to be the only
way of telling that you are using the Microsoft C package.

The code should (ho ho) compile under Borland C. I would appreciate any
feedback on this, as well as attempts at compiling / using the code using
any other compiler / architecture.

For both Microsoft C and Borland C, I believe there is no "getopt" library
function. To remedy this, and to provide a consistent interface, I've
included the source for the GNU version of getopt (usual GPL applies),
this worked fine under Microsoft C.

Cheers,

Jon
